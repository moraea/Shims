# Moraea non-Metal Frameworks
The core of the non-Metal patches: wrappers for downgraded frameworks, consisting of a mixture of autogenerated stubs and handwritten shims.

## build
Run `Dependencies.tool` to fetch dependencies from GitHub, or set `MORAEA_LOCAL_DEPENDENCIES=1` to use local versions. Run `Build.tool` to generate binaries in the `Build` subfolder. Set `USE_CAT_QC` to use Catalina's QuartzCore; otherwise Mojave's will be used (unstable).

Most users will want to just use [OCLP](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Legacy-Patcher/), which includes stable versions of these fixes.

- fix stuttering/out-of-order frames when seeking in videos with Mojave QuartzCore
- fix beachball with hardware cursor (workaround: downgrade `IOHIDFamily` to Catalina and edit WindowServer's sandbox file to allow `HIDWaitCursorFrameInterval`, or use [this](https://github.com/ASentientBot/monterey/releases/download/2022-3-20/you.can.edit.the.defines.to.make.it.spin.extremely.fast.or.even.backward.lol.zip) beta SkyLight plugin)

- investigate slow compositing in all browsers (at least partially fixed with Mojave QuartzCore)
- investigate broken WebGL in some browsers (workaround: use Chrome's `ignore-gpu-blocklist`)
- improve status bar item resizing, replicant handling
- investigate Maps crash
- fix Photo Booth (workaround: use Big Sur version)
