# Moraea non-Metal Frameworks
The core of the non-Metal patches: wrappers for downgraded frameworks, consisting of a mixture of autogenerated stubs and handwritten shims.

## build
Run `Dependencies.tool` to fetch dependencies from GitHub, or set `MORAEA_LOCAL_DEPENDENCIES=1` to use local versions. Run `Build.tool` to generate binaries in the `Build` subfolder.

Most users will want to just use [OCLP](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Legacy-Patcher/), which includes stable versions of these fixes.
